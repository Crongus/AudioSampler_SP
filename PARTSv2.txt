Old parts document was getting cluttered.

What we learned:
The amount of RAM needed to actually do everything in RAM would be too expensive. Reverting to assumption of flash storage. Feasibility articulated minimally 1 Gbit storage, so for some margin of error we'll use 2 Gbit.
We will still use supplemental RAM, a sufficient amount to not have to flush the clip to flash until it is finished recording, which should make programming a lot easier and leave more room for error in that department. Only possible problem might be pipelining if recording of a second clip is then immediately started. Elect RAM with enough space for two clips, then?
Sheaff says anything in a BGA package isn't wise to elect because it can't be hand-soldered. I think this is a surmountable problem because there is a reflow oven available in Ferland, but probably if a comparable option is available in a non-BGA package it does make sense to save ourselves the headache.
STM32H7 has no built-in S/PDIF tx, only rx. Finding a (standalone) S/PDIF codec seemed non-trivial. However, there are DACs available that have a side-pocket S/PDIF output, so that is probably the way to go.
	This is wrong, see "New insight 9/27 and 9/30"
Toshiba 1950 Toslink tx and rx connectors (ie the only ones currently in stock from a reputable major supplier) are probably the way to go for the time being. Screwing around with rare/end-of-life options is a bridge to cross if I have time to do so.
Toslink connectors are pretty expensive, but validating Toslink functionality is nontrivial (high signaling frequency on a single wire), so we may still have to burn a few of these. The comparatively smaller number of legs might make them recoverable off the board? Maybe? 

Some speculation:
I have zero idea what we may or may not need in the way of R-L-C, diodes, transistors, et cetera. Probably some bandpass filtering on analog audio paths is appropriate, probably some capacitors in or near power delivery, other than that I'm out of my depth. Will manufacturers (of flash and RAM e.g.) have recommended circuit configurations in their datasheets? The datasheet for a Toslink tx connector I looked at had that....
One 45 sec clip will require minimally 64 Mbit (VERY minimally, with only about 500 Kbit margin for error). Therefore a 128 Mbit RAM chip theoretically could store two full CD quality clips. On the other hand, a 256 Mbit chip is only like three bucks - so is there any good reason not to do that, and give ourselves the room to work with?
	Liam's thoughts: Too clever by half, just don't allow recording of a second clip while the first one is still flushing. That works 	for me and doesn't contravene the contract. 128 Mbit it is, then
My assumption about the combo DAC I found was wrong (it doesn't do I2S input and SPDIF output at the same time, it's principally a USB device). Need to hit the bricks again on this. Keywords that seem promising: "codec," "transmitter," "transceiver," "encoder"

New insight 9/27 and 9/30:
Did some googling, found a suitable S/PDIF transceiver from TI that was linked in a discussion on the TI forums. Upon pulling up the product page on Digikey I think the reason why I wasn't finding anything when I tried to do it the normal way is because Digikey's listing is bad (S/PDIF transcoding is one of the main functions of this IC but S/PDIF is not a listed format in that section or anywhere else on the DK product page). I would like to be able to do a comparo and get a firmer sense of whether this is the best value for purpose, but because I was doing so badly in my previous effort I think this would take more time than it's worth, and I feel that comfortably meeting spec for $2.50 out the door is already good enough so as to make it not worth the bother.
If for some reason we would like to fear the wrath of a cruel God here's an interesting post on doing S/PDIF completely in software: https://scanlime.org/2011/04/spdif-digital-audio-on-a-microcontroller/

New insight 10/1:
I don't know why I defaulted to Toslink as the physical S/PDIF layer we're going to use (probably just because I think it's cool), S/PDIF over coax (ie normal RCA) will be much easier and cheaper to meet minimal specifications, and I can screw around with "upgrading" it to Toslink later if time & resources allow.
This saves nearly 30 bucks in BOM costs per build (!) and allows to run the whole thing off one 3.3 V rail rather than needing to also have 5 V available for the Toslink rx/tx.

So at this juncture we need:
µcontroller
RAM
Flash
ADC
DAC
S/PDIF tx encoder
RCA stereo connector board (2x)
Single RCA for S/PDIF (2x)
Toslink rx connector (this and Toslink tx connector superseded but kept for reference, see "New insight 10/1")
Toslink tx connector
Prebuilt AC->DC power supply
BELOW HERE: Parts we think will be available for free in Barrows (but behooves us to go actually grab them for a more definite PCB design)
Buttons (12x)
LEDs (12x)
Potentiometer or rotary encoder
Unknown quantity of RLC, diode, and/or transistor components for line filtering, buffering, or God knows what else

µcontroller:
We wanted an STM32 unit, filtered by F7/H7 series mainly for promisingly high clock. Decided to go H7 after we found no F7 options with 4x I2S. Looking at units available on a dev board, one "only" had 3x I2S. Between the remaining two, one was clocked lower with more flash and RAM, and the other vice versa. We elected the former because we think 280 MHz should still be plenty and we would like the room to work.

STMicroelectronics STM32H7A3ZIT6
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/STM32H7A3ZIT6/11502699
Power supply nominal: 1.8 V or 3.3 V
Current consumption: No more than 200 mA as long as we do not allow the junction temperature to exceed 100 C (datasheet pg 94)
Power consumption: Max 660 mW

RAM:
Filter by 128 Mbit, active and typically stocked / not marketplace, SDRAM, and not using a BGA package. Cheapest options are "LVTTL" interface, I'm not sure if the FMC does this, so filtered further by "parallel" to be safe. Plenty of 54-pin options are available so we can filter out 86-pin because that would be a pain in the neck if even supported. Four cheapest options from "Alliance Memory" (and the next price step up looks similar in all important respects). Discard one that is clocked slower, remaining three are "commercial," "industrial," and "automotive" versions of the same chip. Picked "commercial" version
$3.36
Alliance Memory AS4C8M16SA-6TCN
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/alliance-memory-inc/AS4C8M16SA-6TCN/5214142
Power supply nominal: 3.3 V
Current consumption: I don't know exactly how a RAM current supply is supposed to work, are the datasheet max amounts under various conditions "worst of these" or "these might be happening simultaneously"? If "worst of these," then 70 mA, datasheet pg 18
Power consumption: Max 231 mW if my assumption is correct

Flash:
Filter by 2 Gbit, active and normally stocked / not marketplace, parallel (ie not using an intermediate interface, able to be hooked up directly to the FMC), NAND, 3.3 V supply (to be able to use the same rail as the µcontroller), and NOT using a BGA package. Elected to filter further by SLC for hopefully a little more peace of mind on achievable speed (based upon my experience with consumer flash, i.e. SSDs). Most options are by Kioxia, looked like four different versions of essentially the same chip. Two are severe duty temperature tolerance (don't need), of the remaining two, one has built-in ECC whereas the other makes you implement it yourself. Not having to do ECC ourselves for the same price is a no brainer

Kioxia TC58BVG1S3HTA00
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/kioxia-america-inc/TC58BVG1S3HTA00/5226306
Power supply nominal: 3.3 V
Current consumption: 30 mA (summary on datasheet pg 1, presumably a more complicated table is somewhere further in). Again are the amounts for different conditions additive? I was under the impression that this kind of flash can't be written & read at the same time
Power consumption: Max 99 mW

ADC:
Filter by active, normally stocked / not marketplace, 2 channels, "audio" purpose, I2S interface. Cheapest option under those parameters and easily clears desired sampling rate/bit depth specifications. Also pleasingly small package

AKM AK5720VT
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/asahi-kasei-microdevices-akm/AK5720VT/5180452
Power supply nominal: 3.3 V or 5 V
Current consumption: At 3.3 V nominal, max 10.7 mA for worst case of 96 ksps, datasheet pg 7
Power consumption: 35.3 mW

DAC:
Filter by active, normally stocked / not marketplace, 2 channels, "audio," I2S interface. Cheapest option for parameters, good paper sampling rate / bit depth (incidentally same as ADC). Before we actually order anything I do want to check with someone knowledgeable to make sure we're not cheaping out too hard here at least to be able to handle the minimal frequency response spec. (Vince Weaver said that DACs being noticeably cheaper than a comparable ADC is normal because the latter are more complicated to design.)

Nuvoton NAU8402WG
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nuvoton-technology-corporation/NAU8402WG/4271432
Power supply nominal: 3.3 V
Current consumption: 7.57 mA (datasheet pg 8)
Power consumption: 25.0 mW

S/PDIF tx:
Found this suggested on the TI forums from a Google search since trying to find an S/PDIF encoder the normal way on Digikey/Mouser using keywords and product filtering was going awfully (see digressions at top of page for more information). This does what we want and even has the ability to act asynchronously as an S/PDIF rx at the same time if we can't get the µcontroller's built-in rx going, for what seems to me like a really good price. "PCM9211" costs more for a built-in ADC, redundant for our purposes.

Power supply nominal: 3.3 V
Current consumption: 55.8 mA worst-case, datasheet pg 5
Power consumption: 184.1 mW

RCA connectors for analog stereo:
Two options (in stock & shipping) on Digikey for color-coded stereo left & right in one package, one is right-angle, one is straight-thru. Straight-thru seems cooler if the board is exposed anyway and the price is similar
2 x $2.62 = $5.24
Cliff FW6190

Power supply: n/a
Current and power consumption: n/a

RCA connectors, single for S/PDIF:
Filter by single RCA jack, normally stocked / not marketplace, and orange insulator. (This is not pertinent to functionality but in consumer audio hardware an RCA jack that carries S/PDIF is customarily orange to distinguish from other purposes a single RCA may be used for, eg line-out for a powered subwoofer, which is customarily black.) Five options, three are right angle, one is panel mount, one is straight-thru. Picked the latter.
2 x $1.09 = $2.18

Toslink rx: (SUPERSEDED, DO NOT ORDER, kept for reference)
For this and Toslink tx — 
the market is hard. Toshiba also makes rx/tx that allow you to attach your own LED drive instead of having it built into the receptacle module, but they appear to have been obsoleted or to be on unsustainably long lead times. I'd like vertical-facing for parity with the RCA jacks but that similarly appears to be unobtainium. "A" in the product name means LED drive integrated, I don't know what "F" means, and there would be "V" if it was vertical-facing. The 1950A tx/rx will work for the moment and I will look further into trying to source some without integrated LED drive later on if I have time.
Also: Digikey doesn't sell the 1950 tx/rx, only Mouser does.

Power supply nominal: 5 V (!)

PSU:
Toslink rx and tx modules demand 5 V and no alternatives to those, what a pain in the neck, otherwise we could run it fine off 3.3 V only.
Capacity wise: I need to do some harder math on what this design is going to consume all together. My knowledge from off-the-shelf computer PSUs is that you want to be running at greater than 50% of PSU capacity but not more than 80%, at least for the best efficiency. Would it be possible to run the whole thing off a Digilent 3.3 V Powerbrick and hook the stupid Toslink tx/rx up to the nominal 5 V input pin? — Powerbricks are 30 bucks (!) and can "only" supply 1.1 W max, I haven't looked at cost of actual PSUs on Digikey, but I would be shocked if $30 is the best we can do especially for only a watt out the door
Update 10/01: Obviated need to power Toslink rx/tx, we are all set to go off 3.3 V only. Headline consumption based on datasheet worst-cases will be 1230 mW so we are probably fine out the door with 1.5 W or if we want to be EXTREMELY conservative 2 W.
After research: No 3.3 V 1.5 W supply on the market, 2 W it is.
Options — I like this one: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/zettler-magnetics/HP02S0300WI/18880487
But Liam would prefer this one because it's a bit cheaper: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/IRM-02-3-3/7704627
We'll see. I think cheaping out hard on the PSU may be inadvisable for noise reasons. The orange one is part of its manufacturer's "High Performance" series for whatever that may be worth.
Search filters used: 3.3 V output, AC input, board mounted, normally stocked / not marketplace, 2 W.
We also need an AC receptacle to be able to actually hook the PSU up. This one should suit fine: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/schurter-inc/3-137-731/16903656
I checked into their other models, the cheaper ones in the same series don't have a ground, and the slightly more expensive one is just a different receptacle color.
We're going to need a kludge of some kind to be able to mount this securely to the board.
